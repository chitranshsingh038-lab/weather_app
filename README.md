# weather_app
   
This Python program fetches the current temperature of any city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
It asks the user for a city name and API key, then displays the temperature in Celsius along with the current time.
The script also includes basic error handling for invalid city names or API keys.
Make sure to install the requests library and obtain a free API key from OpenWeatherMap before running the program.
